# Stuck at Black Screen with Blinking Underscore on Booting due to Corrupted Samsung SATA SSD

## Problem
* HP Z238 with Samsung 870 EVO 1TB SATA SSD installed
* It stuck at black screen with blinking underscore(`_`) on booting

## Root Cause
* Corrupted hard drive

  > When you boot a computer, and all it shows is a black or blank screen with a blinking cursor (it may look like an underscore), then it means the BIOS or UEFI is attempting to boot from a source other than the hard drive.

## Solution
Replace corrupted hard drive with a new one.
